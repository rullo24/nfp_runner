# NFP Watchdog
This is a simple GoLang application that acts as a watchdog, monitoring the Downloads folder for newly downloaded .nfp files. When a new .nfp file is detected, the application automatically opens it.

# Use - Windows
- Compile the executable
- Open the shell:startup folder using Win+R
    - This folder is used for running programs just after windows startup
- Copy a shortcut of the executable to this location 
- Restart computer
    - This program should now run when the computer is booted

# Use - Linux
This functionality is untested. Unsure if this works.
